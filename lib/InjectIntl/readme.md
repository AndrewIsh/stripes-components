# Inject Intl
Higher-order component for injecting the `intl` context into a component from a   `react-intl` `<IntlProvider>`. Based on `react-intl`'s `injectIntl()`.

Uses React 16.3 `forwardRef()` to enable cleaner ref handling than `react-intl`'s `injectIntl()`.

## Usage
Use exactly like `react-intl` `injectIntl()`.

## Learning
- [`react-intl` `injectIntl()`](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/blob/master/src/inject.js)
