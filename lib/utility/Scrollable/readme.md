# Scrollable

Adds scroll functionality to area with uniform styling across browsers.

The component will automatically hide the scrollbar when it's not needed and it will also prevent content from jumping when content becomes scrollable.

## Basic Usage

```
import { Scrollable } from '@folio/stripes-components/lib/utility/Scrollable';

...
<Scrollable>
  <div>
    My content
  </div>
</Scrollable>
```
